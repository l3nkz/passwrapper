#passwrapper

Have you always wanted to use multiple password stores for different proposes?
For example one password store for your passwords at work and another one for you private
passwords?

While this is basically possible with native [pass]("http://www.passwordstore.org/" 'Pass')
it is quite a hassle to do use it.

This script massively simplifies such a use case by allowing simple switching, creating and
removing of such password stores.
